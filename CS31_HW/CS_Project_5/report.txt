a. A brief description of notable obstacles you overcame.

When coming up with a solution to calculate the planets and stars, I tried a few different implementations but would either have an issue traversing the smaller of the two words or not get the correct calculation. I decided to split this into two separate problems to solve. First I solved the C string traversal issue by only traversing the length of the smaller of the secret and trial string. I then implemented the actual calculating part by using copies of both c strings and using two loops first to check for stars and second to check for planets. Each for loop replaces star and planet chars with a '.' to make sure they are not matched again. 

b. A description of the design of your program. You should use pseudocode in this description where it clarifies the presentation. Document the design of your main routine, runOneRound, and any other functions you write. Do not document the getWords or randInt functions.

Function stringIsLower (used inside runOneRound):

for each word in wordlist
   if trail is equal to word
      return true
return false if no match
------------------------------------------------

Function inValidWords (used inside runOneRound):

for each char in trail c string
   if char is not lowercase
      return false
return true if c string is lowercase
------------------------------------------------

Function calcPlanetStars (used inside runOneRound):

make copies of both secret and trail c strings
make counter for stars and planets
set counter to the smallest length of secret and trial

for index up to smallest length
   if secretCopy char equals trialCopy char at same index
      increment star count by 1
      replace the char at index of both copies to '.'

for index up to smallest length
   if secretCopy char equals trialCopy char at same index
      increment star count by 1
      replace the char at index of both copies to '.'

for index up to trail length
   if char at index is '.' skip to next index
   
   otherwise
   for index2 up to secret length
   if secretCopy char at index2 equals trialCopy at index
      increment planet count by 1
      replace the char at index2 of secretCopy to '.'
      break to next index of trail length

print count of Stars and Planets
------------------------------------------------

Function runOneRound:

if number of words or secret word index invalid
   return -1

Make score counter
repeat game logic until break
   prompt for trial guess
   if not 4 to 6 letters
      print message for invalid trial word length
      continue and prompt again
   if trial guess not in wordlist
      print message for unknown word
   if trial is equal to secret
      increment score by 1
      break out of loop
   otherwise
      calculate the planets and stars
      increment score by 1
return score
------------------------------------------------

Main Routine:

Declare wordlist
Initialize wordlist and number of words to load into wordlist
Make counter for rounds

if number of loaded rounds less than 1
   print message about insufficient words
otherwise
   prompt user for number of rounds to play
   do not enter game loop if rounds is not positive

make stat counters

repeat until all rounds are finished
   print round and secret word info
   set score to one run of a round
   After a round
   print score of the round and add to total score
   calculate max and min score
   calculate average score
   display all stats
