1. the specific input you provided to the program built from original.cpp in step 5 above that produced incorrect, unusual, or nonsensical output.

How many registered voters were surveyed? 20
How many of them say they will probably vote for Trarris? -5
How many of them say they will probably vote for Hump? 25

-25.0% say they will probably vote for Trarris.
125.0% say they will probably vote for Hump.
Hump is predicted to win the election.

A negative percent is nonsensical for poll result.

==============================================================

2. the error you introduced into logic_error.cpp

At line 30:
if (forTrarris < forHump) 

Changed ">" to "<" to cause incorrect results.
Compiles but returns the opposite of the correct result.

==============================================================

3. the two errors you introduced into compile_error.cpp

At line 11: 
int forHump 

removed semicolon from int declaration to cause syntax/compile-time error
Error Code E0065 - expected a ';'


At line 30: 
if forTrarris > forHump

removed parentheses to cause syntax/compile-time error 
Error Code E0125 - expected a '('


Also resulted in other cascading errors (C2146, C2061, C2181) related to the two main compile errors.
